Reason number one, I have been working.  Working, working, working, all morning, all day, all night.  On power, English, my youth, power, English lessons.  And there's a lot to do.  Almost finished, they will be ready very soon.  We will have a one day only sale.  Powering.  You get my emails you already know about this.

Talk about this in my previous podcast.  And I love these audio tweets because I can do them every day or so convenient."

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him,  he would like to come out hunting with them.  He would answer in the horse voice,  I don't know, and when they said,  would you rather stay in...  inside he would say yes, or no, neither.  He always should make in your choice.  One Friday...  I'm not here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're all in a piece of your little pet.  The young rat caught him up by a usual person's mouth.  No truth, thanks old,  said it was not stepping up with him.  I couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold-blooded.  I don't know, was all the ever answered.  And then he walked off to think.  So now, wherever he would stay in his home,  and wherever he would go out into the rough.  And like the left's really loud,  most in the loft,  there's a very critical place,  the roof,  that the rain foot down from Washington.  The beams in the raptors had all run at you,  so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joists,  do we?  The beams fell with one edge on the surface.  The ground shook,  the people were very close.  All the rest,  they were still coming in with fear and horror.  This won't be the finish.  We can't stay too deaf here.  We can't stay too long.  So that's good for throwing off.  A little later, on that evening,  the sketch combines with a final old fashion performance.  For that, we'll be running through all the little gays  of the old standing poverty,  and that's going to go over our way,  instead of showing off.  Just then, the old red couch side of your mouth,  that was the name of the shriek.  He wasn't in the line,  and he wasn't in the line.  He stood just back here,  come on, get in line,  while the old red cuisines.  Of course, you're coming too,  and don't know,  set off, or come,  but the idea of it,  you don't think it's safe here.  But in more, do you?  And not safe,  that has a banish,  you do, but not for them yet.  Well, it'll be alright.  I think I'll go tomorrow,  he's editing himself,  but then again,  perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the line,  just to make up my mind.  We'll go into the night there in the big...  crash, down came mean rapid noise,  over.  Next morning,  it was a foggy day,  someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them  that the old building was not haunted by rats,  but at last one of them happened to move a board,  and he cut side of a young rat,  hope dead.  That's the shirker got his due,  and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like it.  But he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no or an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great God.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked in a little scare.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie.  She became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago.  Three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to...  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  No, no, no.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to...  to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  No, you do not want to sweep a girl named Angelina.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet  or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to...  to sweep Stephanie off her feet? Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not. Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not...  not sweep Stephanie off her feet. She didn't fall in love with her.  But one day, he did ask her for a date. He said, uh-oh.  Uh-oh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did. That's exactly what he said. He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia? Do you want to go to...  do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia if he wanted to go to dinner with me.  Did he ask his best friend? Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend. He wanted to go to dinner with me.  Did he ask his friend or a girl? Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked the girl. Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask? Well, he asked Stephanie.  Uh-oh.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard to save her.  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no. She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family? No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Was she really into exercise?  No, no, no, not on exercise. What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  And she really focused on her career.  Yeah, that's right. She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth that she was really into her career?  We don't know. Maybe not. Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying. Maybe she's not really into her school.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry. I just...  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right. She...  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not. Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  Did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms. His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct. Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  Yeah, that's right. Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Nick's feelings hurt.  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But...  He said for himself,  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Was he going to take...  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes for an answer.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not.  Is he gonna open her ears?  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize?  Yes, he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that she...  He is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open...  He opened her eyes.  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was sh-  He talked and a little scared.  Then even worse.  Then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came...  She was home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where...  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police...  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department...  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after...

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in the horse voice.  I don't know. And when they said, would you rather stay in the house?  Inside he would say yes or no, neither. He always should make a new choice.  One fine day is not Joshi being sent in. I will here. No one will ever care for you if you carry on my dish.  You are no more mine if you are all in a piece you will be okay.  The young rat caught him up by unusualness and nothing.  Not true. That's so. It was not stepping her foot but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold.  I don't know. It was all the ever answer. And then he walked off to think.  Now, whether he would stay in his home and run from the house into the rough.  One night the riffs really loud, most and most. There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring from down from Washington.  The beams in the raps is at all running to you. So the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last one of the joists did it really. The beams fell one inch on the ceiling.  The girls shook, particularly fell off.  All the rest of the hair stood on the ceiling and the fear and horror.  This was really very, really. We can't stay put the fear and they're not suffering.  So nights kept falling off.  A little later on that evening his cats come back and they find an old fashion porn porn.  But I would be really good for all of them. I think they gave me all of the porn.  Tell me about it. And that's all I know right away. And she don't show them all enough.  Just then the old rat comes out of your mouth. That was the thing with the shriker.  He wasn't in the line. And he wasn't in the line.  He's exactly outside here. He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old rat quistler.  Of course you're coming too. I don't know if you said off the come.  But the idea of it. You don't think it's safe here.  But in more, do you?  And I said that as the young Donnie's, he grew, may not fall in yet.  Well, so the old rat can't live quickly.  But you join us in terms of your own shrily. Right about face parts.  And you don't want to hurt your ex.  And you don't want to hurt your ex.  I think I'll go tomorrow. He's editing himself.  But then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here. I guess I'll go back to my old under the line.  Just to make up my mind.  We learned that might be a big crash.  Down came the old rat to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed I had to then that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard.  And he cut sight of him.  The old rat, height dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shriker got his due and there was no warning for him."

He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for  an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally has some space.  Let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe 5 years ago, 3 years ago, but in the past,  once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come on, hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes or no, either.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine sent in, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no longer mine if you're off in the peace you will live with us.  The young rat coughed before quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No true, but so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the  young rat so cold.  I don't know, there's all the answer.  And then he walked off to think, or in how all rat, whether he would stay in his home  and run him over out into the rough.  One night the rats were in the rough horse and the rocks.  There's a very terrible place, the roof, set the ring from down from Washington.  The beams in the rafters had all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last one of the joists stood with me, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people who fell off and all the rest had stood on hand with fear and  horror.  This was good for the evening.  We can't stay, put the fear and they're off, so I sketched for throwing it off.  A little later on that evening, he sketched, and I was in there finding an old fashion  farm for her.  But I would be really good for all of them.  I think we gave you all the points, coming from it.  And that's all I wrote right away, instead of throwing all night.  I was in the old red house side of your mouth.  That was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old red closely.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know, set off or come.  But the idea of it, you don't think it's safe here in more than you.  And I said that as we have done this, you grew, may not fall in here.  We also built a red, you can't look closely.  But you've joined us in terms of your own shakiness, right about the smarts.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You used to burn volume with western.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground, just to make up my mind.  The winter night, there was a big crash.  Downking means right through the joys of the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he cut side of a young rat,  hiked dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shaker got his due and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  One day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  huh, huh, huh, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now,  was Stephanie really into her school right now.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  she wasn't really into her school,  was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying, maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right, she wants some time, independent time,  time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yes, that's right.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, he said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I mean, not, not.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie and he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right. That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  He's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a day.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come on, hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes or no, either.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine sent in, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no longer mine if you're off in the peace you will live with us.  The young rat coughed before quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No true, but so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the  young rat so cold.  I don't know, there's all the answer.  And then he walked off to think, or in how all rat, whether he would stay in his home  and run him over out into the rough.  One night the rats were in the rough horse and the rocks.  There's a very terrible place, the roof, set the ring from down from Washington.  The beams in the rafters had all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last one of the joists stood with me, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people who fell off and all the rest had stood on hand with fear and  horror.  This was good for the evening.  We can't stay, put the fear and they're off, so I sketched for throwing it off.  A little later on that evening, he sketched, and I was in there finding an old fashion  farm for her.  But I would be really good for all of them.  I think we gave you all the points, coming from it.  And that's all I wrote right away, instead of throwing all night.  I was in the old red house side of your mouth.  That was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old red closely.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know, set off or come.  But the idea of it, you don't think it's safe here in more than you.  And I said that as we have done this, you grew, may not fall in here.  We also built a red, you can't look closely.  But you've joined us in terms of your own shakiness, right about the smarts.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You used to burn volume with western.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground, just to make up my mind.  The winter night, there was a big crash.  Downking means right through the joys of the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he cut side of a young rat,  hiked dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shaker got his due and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  One day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  huh, huh, huh, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now,  was Stephanie really into her school right now.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  she wasn't really into her school,  was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying, maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right, she wants some time, independent time,  time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Oh, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm not going to.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a day.  He said,  You want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay.  She laughed nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Good.  Then she said, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Good.  I just need some space.  Okay.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Okay.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Very good.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Okay.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her,  I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said,  Enough.  This is where the police come in.  Very good.  This is where the police come in.  Good.  Then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Good.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right.  That's all.  Very good.  Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer,  and try to tell all of the story.  Everything, yourself.  Just use the key phrases.  All right.  Sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm going to open her eyes.  This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Use those key phrases in your story.  You don't need to memorize every word.  Just try to use the new phrases correct.  Remember this story is about the past.  All righty.  Good.  After you finish this,  after you can remember and tell the story,  go to the next lesson,  the mini-story point of view list.  See you next time.  Bye bye."

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come on, hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes or no, either.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine sent in, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no longer mine if you're off in the peace you will live with us.  The young rat coughed before quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No true, but so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the  young rat so cold.  I don't know, there's all the answer.  And then he walked off to think, or in how all rat, whether he would stay in his home  and run him over out into the rough.  One night the rats were in the rough horse and the rocks.  There's a very terrible place, the roof, set the ring from down from Washington.  The beams in the rafters had all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last one of the joists stood with me, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people who fell off and all the rest had stood on hand with fear and  horror.  This was good for the evening.  We can't stay, put the fear and they're off, so I sketched for throwing it off.  A little later on that evening, he sketched, and I was in there finding an old fashion  farm for her.  But I would be really good for all of them.  I think we gave you all the points, coming from it.  And that's all I wrote right away, instead of throwing all night.  I was in the old red house side of your mouth.  That was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old red closely.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know, set off or come.  But the idea of it, you don't think it's safe here in more than you.  And I said that as we have done this, you grew, may not fall in here.  We also built a red, you can't look closely.  But you've joined us in terms of your own shakiness, right about the smarts.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You used to burn volume with western.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground, just to make up my mind.  The winter night, there was a big crash.  Downking means right through the joys of the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he cut side of a young rat,  hiked dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shaker got his due and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  One day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  huh, huh, huh, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now,  was Stephanie really into her school right now.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  she wasn't really into her school,  was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying, maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right, she wants some time, independent time,  time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Oh, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm not going to.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him,  he would like to come out hunting with them.  He would answer in the horse voice,  I don't know, and when they said,  would you rather stay in...  inside, he would say yes, or no, neither.  He always should make in your choice.  One five day...  is not just you being sent in.  I will here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're all in a piece of your little pet.  The young rat caught him of quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true.  Then so, it was not stepping up with him.  I couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold-blooded.  I don't know, was all the ever answered.  And then he walked off to think.  So now, whether he would stay in his home,  whether he would go out into the rough.  And like the left's really loud, most in the loft,  there's a very critical place, the roof,  that the rain foot down from Washington.  The beams and the raptors had all run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joists, really weird.  The beams fell with one edge on the surface.  The ground shook, the people would fell off.  All the rest, they were still coming in with fear and horror.  This won't be the finish.  We can't stay to the fear of death.  And that's the end of the episode.  A little later, on that evening,  the sketch comes out and says they found an old fashioned horror.  For that would be, we wouldn't go through all of it.  We could get the old ones coming from it.  And that's all I know.  We're going to stay on the floor and all.  Just near the old red house side of your mama,  that was the name of the shriek.  He wasn't in the lawn, and he wasn't in the lawn.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Wow, the old red Christmas.  Of course you're coming too,  and don't know if you're coming.  But the idea of it, you don't think it's safe here.  You're in more to me.  And not safe, but as you understand it,  you do may not fall in here.  Where's the old red?  Where you've joined us,  when you came to the early shriek,  right about face marks.  And you don't want a heart next.  I think I'll go tomorrow.  He said to himself,  but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the lawn  just to make up my mind.  We'll go into the night there in the big...  crash, down came mean rapid noise over.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move a board,  and he got set of young rats,  hope deadly.  He was gone for nothing and half out of his hole.  Thus the shriek got his due,  and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like it.  But he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no or an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great God.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie.  She became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally, let's go back to the beginning.  I don't know, maybe 10 years ago.  Three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  He wanted to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her.  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep?  He is sister of her feet.  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named?  Angelina off her feet.  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep?  He wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her feet.  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Julia off her feet.  He wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Well, no, he could not, unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  Did he ask Julia if she wanted to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia if she wanted to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not.  Did he ask his best friend?  Did he want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not.  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, and she said, I'm really...  Stephanie into my job right now was Stephanie really into her school right now.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Really into exercise.  Really love exercise, really focused on exercise.  Really concentrating on exercise.  No, no.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell her Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time independent time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  She just needs some space from her friends.  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space?  From her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, he needs space from Nick.  He told Nick, I just need some space.  He just wants to be away from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's feelings hurt?  Arms hurt.  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  No, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie.  Same question, right?  It's a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said for himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no, he was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't done it.  I am not going to.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept it.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, he said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly...  Would he take yes for an answer?  Would he love for her to say yes?  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  No, no, no.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Would Nick go to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Well, Nick...  He's going to make her realize he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her...  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was...  What's going to open Stephanie's eyes?  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie and he told her...  I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is what...  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said...  She said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, Stephanie finally has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time.  I will tell the story after key phrases, after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Happy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's stop.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.

    "transcript_full": "Hey everyone, it's AJ and I just realized I have not done a podcast in a long time.  Oh, no.  So back.  The reason there are a few reasons that I have not.  Reason number one, I have been working.  Working, working, working, all morning, all day, all night.  On Power English, my new Power English lessons.  And there's a lot to do.  Almost finished.  They will be ready very soon.  We will have a one day only sale.  Power English.  Anyway.  You get my emails you already know about this.  More, you want more information, sign up for my email course.  The other reason that I have not done a podcast is that I have been doing audio tweets.  Talk about this in my previous podcast.  And I love these audio tweets because I can do them every day or so convenient."

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in the horse voice.  I don't know. And when they said, would you rather stay in the house?  Inside, he would say yes or no, neither. He always should make a new choice.  One fine day is Arthur should be sent in. I will here. No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no longer mine if you're off in the beach, you will live with us.  The young rat caught the quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true, but so it was not stepping up with it, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold.  I don't know. It was awful.  I don't know how long will he ever answer. And then he walked off to take away an hour.  Whether he would stay in his home and then go out into the rough.  The night the riffs really loud, lost in the loft.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the rain foot down, come wash it again.  The beams and the raps is at all right at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe. At last, one of the joists did we.  The beams fell with one inch on the surface.  The rolls shook, the pupils fell off, and all the rest pears stood on hand with fear and horror.  This won't be the finishery. We can't stay, because that's here.  The wind is blowing up, so it's a nice sketch for throwing off.  A little later, one evening, the sketch came back, which is a day of finding old fashion on top.  But that would be really good for all of it.  We could give you all of it once, come and throw it.  And then throw it all over the way, instead of throwing it off.  Just then throw it right outside of your mouth.  That was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, we're all back, who is this?  Of course you're coming too, and don't know, set off, or come.  But that idea of it, you don't think it's safe here in more of the room?  And I said that as you're done, you do may not fall in here.  Well, should be alright.  You can't look closely.  But you've joined us in terms of your journey, right about these marks.  And you don't want a horse back.  You used to burn volume with Western.  I think I've got a model he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'd go back to my old under the line, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means reacting to the joy of the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move a board, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, and...  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry. I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm gonna show her...  I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So, Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you!  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough!  This is where the police come in.  Then, he called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail and...  Stephanie finally has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe 5 years ago, 3 years ago.  But in the past, once, there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl.  He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to sweep his sister off her feet.  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl name?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl name Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well...  He wanted to sweep a girl name Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with her.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh uh uh uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly right.  Somebody said he said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask him.  He asked his best friend, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No?  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  And she really focused on her career.  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she...  Truthfully, was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, he needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  He just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  It's a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because...  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not...  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not going to.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize?  Yes, he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked.  And a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where...  Where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department...  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  The Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after...  Many phrases, after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  That's function.  One step was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted...  to sweet Stephanie off her feet. Good. He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her  feet. Good. But he was too shy. One day he finally asked her for a day. He said,  you want to go to dinner with me? Good. You want to go to dinner with me? Okay. She  laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now. Good. I'm really into my job right now.  Very good. Then she said, I'm sorry. I just need some space. Good. I just need some space.  Okay. Knit's feelings were hurt. Knit's feelings were hurt. Okay. He knew Stephanie didn't like him,  but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for an answer. Good. I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Good. I'm going to show her. I'm a great guy. I'm gonna open-  her eyes. Very good. I'm gonna open her eyes. Okay. So Knit bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her,  I love you. Stephanie was shocked and a little scared. Then Knit started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried. Finally, Knit broke into her apartment. When Stephanie came home,  she said, enough. This is where the police-  come in. Very good. This is where the police- come in. Good. Then she called the police. Now Knick is in  jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  Okay. And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right. That's all. Very good. Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer,  and try to tell all of the story, everything, yourself. Just use the key-  phrases. All right. Sweet. Stephanie off her feet. Really into my job right now. I just need some space.  Next feelings were hurt. I ain't gonna take no for an answer. You're gonna open her eyes.  This is where the police- come in. Stephanie finally has some space. Use those key phrases in your  story. You don't need to memorize every word. Just try to use the new phrases correct.  I remember this story is about the past. All righty. Good. After you finish this,  after you can remember and tell the story, go to the next lesson, the mini-story point of view,  see you next time. Bye-bye."

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true, but so, it was not stepping up with, but she couldn't be able to see the young  rat so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or  go out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, almost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that the reenforged down from Washington, the beams and the rats as it all run at  you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  As last one of the joists, the beam fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people really fell off, and all the rats peered through to him with  fear and horror.  This was good, really great, we can't stay put the fear and they're not suffering, so  that's good for throwing it off.  A little later on, I didn't even just get to come back and say, they found an old fashion  horror.  But I would be really good for all of them, because they could give you all of it when it's  coming from it, and that's from the old, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  It was then the old rat outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while the old rat coarsely, of course you're coming too, I don't know,  they're not coming, they're coming, they're coming.  You don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm certain that as we're in Donnie's group, we may not fall down yet.  We also feel red, you can't live thirsty, but you join us when you turn to the other  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground to have just to make up my mind.  But during the night there was a big crash, downking, being dragged through the joys of the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he cut side of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for  an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great God.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in the  past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh, uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm, yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  and she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  Oh, we don't know.  Maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not going to take no for an answer.  I'm not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize.  Make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every week.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right, that's exactly right.  She decided, this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, Stephanie, is definitely awesome space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl.  Name Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  Good.  I'm really into my job right now.  Very good.  Then she said, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Good.  I just need some space.  Okay.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Okay.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Very good.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Okay.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Very good.  This is where the police come in.  Good.  Then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has some space.  That's all.  Very good.  Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer, and try to tell all of the story, everything, yourself.  Just use the key phrases.  Next week, Stephanie offered feed.  Really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm going to open her eyes.  This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Use those key phrases in your story.  You don't need to memorize every word.  Just try to use the new phrases correctly.  Remember this story is about the past.  Alrighty.  Good.  After you finish this, after you can remember and tell the story, go to the next lesson.  The mini-story point of view list.  See you next time.  Bye bye."

Reason number one, I have been working, working, working, working, all morning, all day, all night,  on Power English, my new Power English lessons.  And there's a lot to do.  Almost finished.  They will be ready very soon.  We will have a one day only sale, Power English.  Anyway, you get my emails you already know about this.  More, you want more information? Sign up for my email course.  The other reason that I have not done a podcast in something is that I have been doing audio tweets.  Talk about this in my previous podcast.  And I love these audio tweets because I can do them every day or so convenient."

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true, but so, it was not stepping up with, but she couldn't be able to see the young  rat so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or  go out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, almost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that the reenforged down from Washington, the beams and the rats as it all run at  you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  As last one of the joists, the beam fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people really fell off, and all the rats peered through to him with  fear and horror.  This was good, really great, we can't stay put the fear and they're not suffering, so  that's good for throwing it off.  A little later on, I didn't even just get to come back and say, they found an old fashion  horror.  But I would be really good for all of them, because they could give you all of it when it's  coming from it, and that's from the old, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  It was then the old rat outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while the old rat coarsely, of course you're coming too, I don't know,  that's one of them happy to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat, quite dead,  half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shaker got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for  an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great God.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in the  past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh, uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm, yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  and she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  Oh, we don't know.  Maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, so he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I mean, so he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every week.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in.  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases.  After important phrases with new vocabulary.  New idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true, but so, it was not stepping up with, but she couldn't be able to see the young  rat so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or  go out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, almost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that the reenforged down from Washington, the beams and the rats as it all run at  you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  As last one of the joists, the beam fell with one inch on the third one.  The rolls shook, the people really fell off, and all the rats peered through to him with  fear and horror.  This was good, really great, we can't stay put the fear and they're not suffering, so  that's good for throwing it off.  A little later on, I didn't even just get to come back and say, they found an old fashion  horror.  But I would be really good for all of them, because they could give you all of it when it's  coming from it, and that's from the old, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  It was then the old rat outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while the old rat coarsely, of course you're coming too, I don't know,  you don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm sure that, as we have done, he grew, may not fall down yet.  We also do read, he can't look closely, but he joined us in terms of the early shabby,  right about face marks, and we don't want to hurt that, he used the bone volume of the  western.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here, I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground, just to  make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash, down came beans wrapped through the joys of  the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day, some men came to look over the damage, it seemed odd  to them that the old building was not haunted by rats, but at last one of them happened  to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat, quite dead, half in and half out of  his hole.  Thus, the shirker got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for  an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great God.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in the  past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh, uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm, yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say,  and she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  Oh, we don't know.  Maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, so he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I mean, so he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every week.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in.  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him,  he would like to come out hunting with them.  He would answer in the horse voice,  I don't know, and when they said,  would you rather stay in...  inside, he would say yes, or no, neither.  He always should make in your choice.  One five day...  is not just you being sent in.  I will care.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you are all in a piece of your little pet.  The young rat caught him of quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true.  And so, it was not stepping her foot.  But she...  couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold-blooded.  I don't know, was all the ever answered.  And then he walked off to think.  So, in an hour or so,  whether he would stay in his home,  whether he would go out into the rough.  And like the rest, really loud,  lost and lost,  there's a very critical place,  the roof,  that the rain foot down,  from Washington.  The beams and the raptors had all run at you,  so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joists,  really weird.  The beams fell with one edge,  on the surface.  The girl was shook,  a humanly fell off,  and...  All the rest,  had her students on hand,  with fear and horror.  This won't be the family dream.  We can't stay to the fear of death.  For that would be,  we wouldn't go through all of it.  We could give you all the things coming from it.  And that's all I know,  by the way,  is what I'm sure of.  Just near the old red house side of your mouth,  that was the name of the shirk.  He wasn't in the line,  and he wasn't in the line.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Wow, the old red Christmas.  Of course, you're coming too,  and don't know,  set off the coming,  by the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here?  You're in more, do you?  And not safe,  but as you understand,  you do, but not for them yet.  Well, that would be all right.  I think I'll go tomorrow,  he said to himself,  but then again,  perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old,  under the line,  just to make up my mind.  We'll go into the night there in the evening.  Next morning,  it was a foggy day.  Someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them  that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last,  one of them happened to move a board,  and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite deadly.  That's the shirker got his due,  and there was no warning for him."

He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like it.  But he said to himself, I ain't going to take no or an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally, has some space.  Let's go back to the beginning.  There was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He is a sister of her feet.  Well, no, no, of course not.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named?  Angelina off her feet.  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her feet.  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not, unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Yes, he did, that's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia, do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his...  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  No, she didn't want to go to dinner with me.

And she really focused on her career, was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.

Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said for himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for...  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, I am not going.  To take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused, he said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes for an answer.  He would love for her.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course, he's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize?  Yes, he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that.  He is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.

No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked.  And a little scared.  Then even worse.  Then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where...  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police...  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department...  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police.  She said this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.

Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space for Nick?  Well, she has space for Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after...  I will pause, please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  I will pause, please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's stop.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl.  Name Stephanie.  He wanted...  He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a day.  He said...  You want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay.  She laughed.  And said...  I'm really into my job right now.  Good.  I'm really into my job right now.  Very good.  Then she said...  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Good.  I just need some space.  Okay.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Okay.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said to himself...  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Good.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Good.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Very good.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Okay.  So Nick bought 500 roses.  I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said...  Enough!  This is where the police come in.  Very good.  This is where the police come in.  Good.  Then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Good.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right.  That's all.  Very good.  Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer,  and try to tell all of the story everything yourself.  Just use the key phrases.  All right.  Sweep Stephanie off her feet really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings.  I'm going to open her eyes.  This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Use those key phrases.  You don't need to memorize every word.  Just try to use the new phrases correct.  Remember this story is about the past.  All righty.  Good.  After you finish this, after you can remember and tell the story,  go to the next lesson, the mini-story point of view list.  See you next time.  Bye bye."

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mind.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know.  When they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, neither.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mind if you're off in the beast, you will live with grass.  The young rat caught him quite as usual, but there's nothing.  No truth.  That's so sad, it was not stepping up with him, but she couldn't be able to see the young  rat so cold, but I don't know, there's all the evidence.  And then he walked off to take away an hour or a half, whether he would stay in his  house, or he would go out into the raft.  One night the rats really loud, lost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that they're eating from down, from washing can, the beams and the rats as it all  run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe, at last one of the joist's good way, the beams  fell with one inch on the third one.  The girls shook, the people really fell off, and all the rats had stood.  The rats on the head were steered and hollowed.  This was good, we can't stay, put the fear in the loft, so that's good for falling  off.  A little later, on that evening, the rats came back and said they found an old fashion  box.  But I would, they wouldn't go through all of it, they could give you all of it once, coming  from it.  And that's all I know, by way, I'm sure I'm sure I'm all not.  Just near the old rat, outside of your mouth, that was the thing with the shriek, he wasn't  alone, and he wasn't exactly outside of it, he stood just back here, come on, get him  around, while the old rat quistled.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off to come, but the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here in Moa, do you?  And I'm certain that as we have done this, the group may not fall down yet.  Well, so the old rat, you can't look closely, but you've joined us in time to get a little  closer.  I think I'm going to go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here, I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground.  Just to make up my mind.  I was a foggy day, some men came to look over the damage, it seemed odd to them that the  old building was not haunted by rats, but at last one of them happened to move aboard,  and he cut sight of a young rat, heaped in, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shriek got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for an  answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally, has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe 5 years ago, 3 years ago, but in the past,  once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want...  To sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named...  Angelina off her feet.  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted...  He wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy, so he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  He didn't fall in love with her.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm, yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Oh, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Uh, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no.  She wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really love exercise, really focused on exercise?  Really concentrating on exercise?  No?  No, no.  I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she...  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into...  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were...  Nick's arms hurt.  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings.  Were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't...  He didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said for himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no.  I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  Is he going to open her eyes?  Was Nick going to open her ears?  No.  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize?  He was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked.  And a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every week.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police...  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does...  Is Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story.  After key phrases, after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl.  Name Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her...  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay.

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time, there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in a piece, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true.  But so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat  so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night, the rats really loud, lost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that they're eating from down, from washing can, the beams and the rats as it all  run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe, as last one of the joist's good way, the beams fell  with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, they typically fell off, and all the rats had stood on hand with fear  and horror.  This was good, really, we can't stay put the fear and horror, so that's good for throwing  it off.  A little later, on that evening, the rats came back and said, they found an old flashing  horror.  But I would think, it wasn't good for all of them, because they could give you all of it  once, coming from it.  And that's wrong, I don't know, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  The rats went all red outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while we're all back closely.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off or come, but the idea of it, you don't  know, you can stay here in more, do you?  And I'm certain that, as we have done, the group may not fall in yet.  We also be all red, you can't look closely.  For you, join us, in turn to the other evening, right about these marks, and we don't want  to knock back.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, the rats I want.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rats to enjoy the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in  the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no.  It's not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her  feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no.  He could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy, so he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm.  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Nope.  He didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked the girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Uh, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know if she didn't want to.  She laughed and herbicide, huh, huh.  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, he said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears to no?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course, he's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Who's eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie,  and he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her  every night.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment.  Secretly, when Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right, that's exactly right.  She decided, this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police,  or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  Oh no, didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in,  and then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail, he's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie, awesome space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause, please repeat, repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go, let's stop.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, he wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said, you wanna go to dinner with me?  Good, you wanna go to dinner with me?  Okay, she laughed nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Good, I'm really into my job right now.  Very good, then she said, I'm sorry,  I just need some space.  Good, I just need some space.  Okay, Nick's feelings were hurt.

And the situation,  when Allah said,  Let us have a look at our next story.  Isn't it strange?  How can Allah eat such things?  How can He eat things?  I eat�s.  What is the end?  Everyone has been crying.  How did you see it?  I was happy when I heard it.  I was sad when I heard it.  This was what I saw in the crying.  people who are more than 100 people,  all that is being said is that the number of the hundreds of people you are receiving,  the number of people you have received is increasing,  when you go there,  you can get a lot of money from the time you receive a lot of money from the time you get it.

I'm going to send you the message of the Deaf and the Deaf to the Deaf.  I'm going to send you the message of the Deaf and the Deaf to the Deaf.  So this was not going to happen, Allah wanted to destroy this world.  But when I was in the middle of the war,  I was born in the first note of the film that I was looking at and I was thinking.  I tell our people that they can think of something, but they won't like it if they don't like it.  So most of the time, in the middle of the night, all the people came to me and told me that they were coming to me.  to which we give our home to the people of India, to the people of India and to the people of India.  in the name of Allah.  Mano Manal, that there is no such thing as there is no one to do it.  This is the whole of Allah.  Allah is for Allah.  When he said, this is the whole of Allah, that there is a death in me.  And this is my death.  If today is done,  I will tell you what I want.  I want to say that I have returned.  I have returned.  I have returned to you to the whole of Allah.  I have returned to you to the whole of Allah.  You have done so many good things for me.  In the name of Allah, in the name of Allah, there is a doctor.  Jhan, Aapni, Aapdhyaay, and this name comes in the name of God.  The people of Korat, Aapdhyaay, and Jhani, are worshipping God.  Now, the people of Korat are worshipping God.  The people of Korat are worshipping God.  I am talking about the great thing.  Jhani, Aapdhyaay is also worshipping God.  But they are worshipping God.  They can only eat a little of life.  The people of Korat합aji Naluikra are also worshipping God.  They are worshipping God.  I don't believe this.  Yes, give life to your loved ones, don't believe in God.  So in Allah's name,  your life, your life, your life is in God's name.  Yes, today, and this is God's name.  It is in your life, your life is in God's name.

If you are in Allah's name,  then this is the answer.  And this is the answer.  This is the answer.  If you are in Allah's name,  don't believe in God,  if you are in Allah's name,  then this is Allah's name.  So in Allah's name,  If you are in Allah's name,  then this is the answer.

Who is the officer of the state of Allah, who is not God,  and the person who is the leader of the state of Allah,  who is the chief and who is the leader of the state of Allah,  who is the primary officer of the state of Allah.  That's right.  I'm not going to tell you what you're doing.  You're not going to tell me what you're doing to me.  There is a place where you are in your house, where you are not.  Where you are not, where you are not.  Where you are not, where you are not.  And you know you are not going anywhere in your life.  You are going anywhere.  Allah  Allah  Allah  He  Allah  Allah  In the last un-dead memory of the Prophet, the Lord of all.  He was the existence of the life and the life of the whole world.

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time, there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in a piece, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true.  But so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat  so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night, the rats really loud, lost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that they're eating from down, from washing can, the beams and the rats as it all  run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe, as last one of the joist's good way, the beams fell  with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, they typically fell off, and all the rats had stood on hand with fear  and horror.  This was good, really, we can't stay put the fear and horror, so that's good for throwing  it off.  A little later, on that evening, the rats came back and said, they found an old flashing  horror.  But I would think, it wasn't good for all of them, because they could give you all of it  once, coming from it.  And that's wrong, I don't know, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  The rats went all red outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while we're all back closely.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off or come, but the idea of it, you don't  know, you can stay here in more, do you?  And I'm certain that, as we have done, the group may not fall in yet.  We also be all red, you can't look closely.  For you, join us, in turn to the other evening, right about these marks, and we don't want  to knock back.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, the rats I want.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rats to enjoy the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in  the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no.  It's not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her  feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no.  He could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy, so he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm.  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Nope.  He didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked the girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Uh, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know, she didn't want to.  She laughed and her to say,  huh, huh, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now,  was Stephanie really into her school right now.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school,  was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise,  really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth?  That she was really into her job.  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying, maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms, his arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  No, for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no, he was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't done it.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every day.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, Stephanie finally has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time, there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know, and when they said, would you rather stay inside,  he would say yes, or no, neither, he'd always shake making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here, no one will ever care for you  if you carry on like this, you are no longer mine if you're off in a piece, you'll live  with grass.  The young rat coughed in the quiet as usual, but says nothing.  No, true.  But so, it was not stepping up with her, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat  so cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night, the rats really loud, lost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, that they're eating from down, from washing can, the beams and the rats as it all  run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe, as last one of the joist's good way, the beams fell  with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, they typically fell off, and all the rats had stood on hand with fear  and horror.  This was good, really, we can't stay put the fear and horror, so that's good for throwing  it off.  A little later, on that evening, the rats came back and said, they found an old flashing  horror.  But I would think, it wasn't good for all of them, because they could give you all of it  once, coming from it.  And that's wrong, I don't know, right away, instead I'm sure I'm all not.  The rats went all red outside of your mouth, that was the name of the shaker.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here, come  on, get in line, while we're all back closely.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off or come, but the idea of it, you don't  know, you can stay here in more, do you?  And I'm certain that, as we have done, the group may not fall in yet.  We also be all red, you can't look closely.  For you, join us, in turn to the other evening, right about these marks, and we don't want  to knock back.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, the rats I want.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rats to enjoy the whole business.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in  the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no.  It's not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet.  It's romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her  feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no.  He could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy, so he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm.  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Nope.  He didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, we did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked the girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie, uh, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know. She didn't want to. She laughed and herbicide. And she said,  I'm really into my job right now was Stephanie really into her school right now.  No, no, no, no, no. She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family? No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise? Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise. No, no, not on exercise. What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now. Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career? Yeah, that's right. She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully? Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know. Maybe not. Maybe she was lying. Maybe she's not really into her job. Maybe  she wasn't really into her job. But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now. I'm sorry.  I just need some space. Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right. She wants some time, independent time, time alone. She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends? No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents? Well, again, probably not. Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick. She told Nick, I just need some space. He just wants to be  away from Nick. I can need space from Nick. How did Nick feel about this? Well, Nick's feelings were  hurt. Were Nick's arms hurt? No, not his arms. His arms weren't hurt. Was his head hurt?  Oh no, his head was not hurt. Was he very sad? Yes, that's correct. Nick was very sad. Nick's feelings  were hurt. Was Nick upset? I'm very upset. Yeah, that's right. Nick was very upset. Nick's feelings  were hurt. Who hurt Nick's feelings? Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie? Same question, right? Just a little different. Yes, that's  right. Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie. Why were Nick's feelings hurt? Well, because he  knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he didn't give up. He said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer. Was he going to take no for an answer? No, no, no. He was not going to take no  for an answer. He said, I ain't. I am not going to take no for an answer. I ain't done. I am not  going to take no for an answer. Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie? No, he would not  accept no. He would not accept this answer. He refused. He said, no, I will not accept this. I  ain't going to take no for an answer. Would he take yes for an answer? Well, yeah, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer. He certainly would take yes. He would love for  her to say yes. He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer. He said, I'm going to show her  I'm a great guy. I'm going to open her eyes. Was Nick going to open her ears?  No, no, he's not going to open her ears. Is he going to open her eyes? Yes, of course. He's  going to open her eyes. Was Nick going to make her realize he was great? Yes, that's exactly what  that means. He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy. He said,  I'm going to open her eyes. I'm going to make her understand how great I am. I'm going to open  her eyes. Whose eyes was he going to open? Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes. Was he going to  open every girl's eyes? No, not every girl. He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes. He said,  I'm going to open her eyes. I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes. I'm going to make Stephanie realize  I'm great. What did he do? How did he try to open her eyes? Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie  and he told her, I love you. Stephanie was shocked and a little scared. Then even worse,  then Nick started to follow her every step. Stephanie became more worried. Finally, Nick  broke into her apartment. He came into her apartment secretly. When Stephanie came home,  she saw him. She was surprised. She was scared. She said, enough. This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police? Yes, that's right. That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in. This is where the police should begin. This is where  I should call the police or when I should call the police. This is where the police come in.  Means time to call the police. Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in? I don't know. Didn't want the fire department  to help. Who did she want to help? Well, she said, this is where the police come in. She wanted  the police to help. She said, this is where the police come in and then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail. He's in prison. And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone? Yes, that's right. Stephanie is finally alone. She's finally  separate from Nick, alone from Nick. She finally has some space. So Stephanie finally has space  from Nick. Yes, that is correct. Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail. Nick is in prison. So finally Stephanie  has some space. Righty, back to the beginning. This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms. I will pause. Please repeat. Repeat my  pronunciation. Not just the words.

How could I see God?  This is what happened and Allah did not see this.  There are so many people who think that they are going to be happy, they are going to be in the center of the temple.  and when he thought that he would go, he would be ready to go.  So he did not want to go.  Allah wanted to destroy this people.  But when I,  Samarkad Daman.  Thota Phala.  Adana.  I got a new one.  I got a new one.  Now, the first thing I want to tell you,  is that I am a Jai Luhui, and this is a story.  There is a story that is very strange.  Someone thinks that  I am a Jai Luhui.  And another one if you devote yourself to the earth and to enjoy the true nature of this world  From there, the word of the Lord is embedded in the form of the Martins.

If he earns his money or that whole thing.  Whatever he is doing is supplied by God,  Yes, give your life, give your desire to the Lord, not to believe in Him.  So in Allah's name,  your life, your desire to the Lord,  you can guess today, and this is the desire.  This is the desire to the Lord,  and this is the desire to the Lord,  to the Lord, not to believe in Him.  In Allah's name,  this is the desire to the Lord,  to the Lord, not to believe in Him,  to the Lord,  not to believe in Him,  to the Lord, not to believe in Him.

When the kovand is in a condition, the kovand is in a condition that is in a condition of the jain.  Ah!  This is the light of the samtayat here.  I don't know if the mind is there or not.  Can I not be there?  Right.  Go, the mind is there.  Do you believe in God samtayat?  Yes, I do.  But what do you believe in God?  There is no lie.  So I don't believe in God.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him,  he would like to come out hunting with them.  He would answer in the horse voice,  I don't know, and when they said,  would you rather stay in...  inside, he would say yes.  Or no, neither.  He always should make in your choice.  One five day...  Is Arthur she been sent in?  I will care.  No one will ever care for you,  if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you are all in a piece of your little pet.  The young rat caught him of quiet as usual,  but there's nothing.  Not true.  And so,  it was not stepping her foot,  but she...  couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold-blooded.  I don't know,  it was all the ever answered.  And then he walked off to think.  Right now,  whether he would stay in his home  or go out into the rough.  And like the rest,  really loud,  lost and lost,  there's a very critical place,  the roof,  that the rain foot down,  from Washington.  The beams and the raptors  had all run at you,  so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last,  one of the joists knew we...  The beams fell with one edge,  on the surface.  The ground shook,  the people that fell off,  and...  all the rest,  have stood from here,  with fear and horror.  This won't be the finish.  We can't stay,  to the fear and...  The wind out,  so that's the sketch  for throwing off.  A little later,  on that evening,  sketch combined  with the final old fashioned horror song.  For that would be, we wouldn't go through all of it, we could give you all of it from standing  probably.  And that's all I know, by the way, instead of I'm sure of all.  Just near the old red house side of your mama, that was the name of the shirk.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't in the line.  And exactly outside of it, he stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Wow, the old red Christmas.  Of course you're coming too, and don't know, set off to come by the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here.  But in more, do you?  And I said that as your money, you do, may not for them yet.  Where's the old red?  Where's the old red?  Where's the old red?  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old brother-in-law just to make up my mind.  We'll go into the night there in the evening.  Next morning, it was a foggy day, someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats, but at last one of them happened to move a board,  and he caught sight of a young rat.  He fell off in and half out of his hole.  Thus the sugar got his due and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like it.  But he said to himself, I ain't going to take no or an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago.  Three years ago, but in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right, he wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He is a sister of her feet.  Well, no, no, of course not.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  He wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her feet.  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Julia off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Well, no, he could not, unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did. That's exactly what he said.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Yes, Julia, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked the girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  Stephanie into my job right now was Stephanie really into her school right now.  She wasn't really into her school, was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Really into exercise, really love exercise, really focused on exercise, really concentrating on exercise.  No, no.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I really into my job right now.  She focused on her career, was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right, she was really focused on her career.  She was telling the truth that she was really into her job.  We don't know, maybe not, maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job, maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job.  Right now, I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Did she tell her Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right, she wants some time independent time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space?  From her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, he needs space from Nick.  He told Nick, I just need some space.  He just wants to be away from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Arms hurt.  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  No, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct, Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  Yeah, that's right, Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie.  Same question, right?  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said for himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no, he was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't done, I am not going to.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept.  No, he would not accept this answer.  He refused, he said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly...  would take yes for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick?  He was going to make her realize he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her...  He realized, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was...  What's going to open Stephanie's eyes?  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  Only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie and he told her...  I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is what...  Where the police come in?  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said...  She said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, Stephanie finally has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time.  I will tell the story after key phrases, after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idiots.  I will pause.

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mind.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice, I don't know.  When they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, neither.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm over here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mind if you're off in the beast, you will live with grass.  The young rat coughed quite as usual, but there's nothing.  No truth.  That soul said was not stepping up with, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat  so cold with her.  I don't know, there's all the evidence.  And then he walked off to take away an hour or a half, whether he would stay in his  house, or he would go out into the raft.  One night the riffs really loud, lost in the loft, there's a very critical place, the  roof, set the ring from down, from Washington, the beams and the rafters that all run at  you.  So the whole thing was...  Quite unsafe.  At last one of the joist's good way, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The girl was shook, particularly fell off, and all the rest had stood on hand with fear  and horror.  This won't move, we can't stay, put the fear in the loft, so it's a nice gap for throwing  it off.  A little later, on that evening, she had to come back and sit there and find an old fashion  compound.  But I would, they wouldn't go for all of it, they could give you all of it, telling  you for all of it.  And that's all I know, right where, instead I'm sure, and all of it.  Just near the old red house side of your mountain, that was the thing with the shriek.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't...  He wasn't exactly outside here, he stood just back here.  Come on, get in line, while we're only back closely.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off to come, but the idea of it, you don't  think it's safe.  You're in more, do you?  And I'm certain that, as we have done, the roof may not fall down yet.  Well, so the old red, you can't look closely.  But you've joined us in time to get a little shriek, right about face marks, only one  of those marks.  You used to go on volume with Western.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the line, just to make up my mind.  Well, during the night, there was a big crash, down came being wrapped in a joist orbit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he cut side of it.  The young rat hiked dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the shrieker got his due, and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said to himself,  I ain't gonna take no or an answer.  I'm gonna show her.  I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said,  Enough!  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago.  Maybe five years ago, three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl.  And Stephanie, he wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  But he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic?  And surprise her and impress her.  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with her.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did. That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.

Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  She loved exercise really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.

Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  What's some time independent time alone?  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Yeah, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I need space from Nick.  Did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Yeah, same question, right?  It's a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Nick's feelings hurt.  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take...  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Not, not.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yeah, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize?  Yes, he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked.  And a little scared.  Then even worse.  Then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where...  Where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department...  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  The Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after...  Steve phrases after important phrases with new vocabulary,  new idioms.  I will pause, please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation, not just the word.  Kepiemai pronunciation.  Here we go.  That's scary.  One star was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted...  to sweet Stephanie off her feet. Good. He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Good, but he was too shy. One day he finally asked her for a day. He said,  you want to go to dinner with me? Good. You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay, she laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  Good. I'm really into my job right now.  Very good. Then she said, I'm sorry. I just need some space.  Good. I just need some space.  Okay. Nix feelings were hurt.  Good. Nix feelings were hurt.  Okay. He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.

Okay, so Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere. Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment. When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Very good. This is where the  police come in.  Good. Then she called the police. Now Nick is in jail.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, that's all. Very good. Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer  and try to tell all of the story, everything yourself.  Just use the key phrases.  All right, sweep Stephanie off her feet really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt. I ain't going to take no for an answer.  You're going to open her eyes. This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space. Use those key phrases in your story.  You don't need to memorize every word. Just try to use the new phrases correct.  I remember this story.  It's about the past.  All righty. Good. After you finish this,  after you can remember and tell the story,  go to the next lesson, the mini-story point of view list.  See you next time. Bye bye."

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice.  I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, either.  He'd always shake, making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live with grass.  The young rat coughed, but quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true.  But so, it was not stepping her foot, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so  cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, lost in the rocks.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring foot down from Washington, the  beams and the rats as it all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joist's good way, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, particularly fell off, and all the rats had stood on him with fear and  horror.  This won't be the finishery.  We can't stay, because the fear and they laugh, so it's an excuse for throwing it off.  A little later, on that evening, he said, come back, you should be finding an old fashioned  horror.  But I would be, he wouldn't go through all of it, and he could give you all of it once,  coming from it.  And that's all I wrote, right where he stood on the floor and all of it.  Just then the old rat comes out of your mouth, that was the thing you had to shake.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside of it.  He stood just back here, come on, get in line, while the old rat quits there.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off to come, but the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm certain that as we've done this, the group may not follow them yet.  Well, so the old rat can't look just for you to join us, when you turn to the old shanny,  right about for his heart.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rat to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago,  in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know, she didn't want to.  She laughed and herbicide, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth?  That she was really into her job.  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, he said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears to no?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yeah, of course, he's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie,  and he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every night.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right, that's exactly right.  She decided, this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police,  or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know, didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie, awesome space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause, please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go, let's stop.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, he wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said, you wanna go to dinner with me?  Good, you wanna go to dinner with me?  Okay, she laughed nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Good, I'm really into my job right now.  Very good, then she said, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Good, I just need some space.  Okay, Nick's feelings were hurt.  What?

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice.  I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, either.  He'd always shake, making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live with grass.  The young rat coughed, but quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true.  But so, it was not stepping her foot, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so  cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, lost in the rocks.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring foot down from Washington, the  beams and the rats as it all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joist's good way, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, particularly fell off, and all the rats had stood on him with fear and  horror.  This won't be the finishery.  We can't stay, because the fear and they laugh, so it's an excuse for throwing it off.  A little later, on that evening, he said, come back, you should be finding an old fashioned  horror.  But I would be, he wouldn't go through all of it, and he could give you all of it once,  coming from it.  And that's all I wrote, right where he stood on the floor and all of it.  Just then the old rat comes out of your mouth, that was the thing you had to shake.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside of it.  He stood just back here, come on, get in line, while the old rat quits there.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off to come, but the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm certain that as we've done this, the group may not follow them yet.  Well, so the old rat can't look just for you to join us, when you turn to the old shanny,  right about for his heart.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rat to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago,  in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed nervously.  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no.  She wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  And she really focused on her career.  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth?  That she was really into her job.  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's arms hurt.  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  It's a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  No for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no.  He would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no.  I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  No.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize.  Make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand.  How great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every day.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  The Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay.  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  Very good.  Then she said, I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Good.  I just need some space.  Okay.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Okay.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Good.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Very good.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Okay.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Very good.  This is where the police come in.  Good.  Then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Good.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right.  That's all.  Very good.  Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer and try to tell all of the story.  Everything.  Yourself.  Just use the key phrases.  All right.  Sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  I'm going to open her eyes.  This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Use those key phrases in your story.  You don't need to memorize every word.  Just try to use the new phrases correct.  Remember this story is about the past.  All righty.  Good.  After you finish this, after you can remember and tell the story,  go to the next lesson, the mini-story point of view list.  See you next time.  Bye-bye."

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make  up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would  answer in the horse voice.  I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, either.  He'd always shake, making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to him, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're off in the beast, you'll live with grass.  The young rat coughed, but quiet as usual, but there's nothing.  Not true.  But so, it was not stepping her foot, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so  cold, but I don't know, there's all the other answer.  And then he walked off to think, right now, whether he would stay in his home, or whether  he'd come out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, lost in the rocks.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring foot down from Washington, the  beams and the rats as it all run at you, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joist's good way, the beams fell with one inch on the third one.  The rats shook, particularly fell off, and all the rats had stood on him with fear and  horror.  This won't be the finishery.  We can't stay, because the fear and they laugh, so it's an excuse for throwing it off.  A little later, on that evening, he said, come back, you should be finding an old fashioned  horror.  But I would be, he wouldn't go through all of it, and he could give you all of it once,  coming from it.  And that's all I wrote, right where he stood on the floor and all of it.  Just then the old rat comes out of your mouth, that was the thing you had to shake.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside of it.  He stood just back here, come on, get in line, while the old rat quits there.  Of course you're coming too, I don't know, set off to come, but the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm certain that as we've done this, the group may not follow them yet.  Well, so the old rat can't look just for you to join us, when you turn to the old shanny,  right about for his heart.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old house, just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rat to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,  quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus, the sugar got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great God.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago,  in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed nervously.  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no.  She wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  And she really focused on her career.  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth?  That she was really into her job.  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's arms hurt.  No, not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  It's a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  No for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no.  He would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no.  I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  No.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize.  Make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand.  How great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie.  And he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every day.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police.  Or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  The Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them  He would answer in the horse voice. I don't know and when they said would you rather stay in some?  I would say yes or no, neither. He always should make a new choice.  One fine day is not Josephine sent in. I will kill. No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you are all in a piece you will live your best.  The young rat caught him acquired his usual business.  Not true, but so it was not stepping her foot but she couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold.  I don't know, there was all the ever answer and then he walked off to think.  When the rat went out, he would stay in his home and run out into the rough.  One night the rats really loud, almost no noise. There is a very terrible place, the roof,  the rain fell down from Washington. The beams and the rats are all run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe. At last one of the joists did way.  The beams fell one inch on the surface. The girls shook.  The cuba lay fur long and all the rats pears stood on the end with fear and horror.  This won't be the finishery. We can't stay put the fear in the lock.  So it's a nice catch for throwing it off.  A little later on that evening, the cats come back and they come back.  They are all crying on the ground.  But that would be really good for all of them.  They could get the other one coming from it.  And they're struggling all the way and they don't see one all night.  Just then the old rat comes out of your mouth. That was the thing with the shriek.  He wasn't...  He couldn't even lie. And he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old rat is a little bit worse.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know if they're coming.  But the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here in Moa, do you?  And I said that as a dumbass, you do not fall in here.  Well, the old rat can't look just for you.  Join us in the time to get a little shriek.  Right about face marks on the long run.  I think I'll go tomorrow.  He said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground.  Just to make up my mind.  The winter night, there was a big crash.  Down came the grass to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed I had to think that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard.  And he cut side of the...  ...the young rat, heaped dead, half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shriek got his due and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  Right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no or an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in the past,  once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.

He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  Yes, that's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named...  Angelina off her feet.  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend?  Girl, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  No, no, no, no, no.  She laughed and heard me say, huh, huh, huh.  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really...  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  And she really focused on her career.  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into...  into her job?  No, we don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but...  I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I think she needs space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's...  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't done enough.  I am not going to take no.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes?  Yes for an answer.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course, he said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I mean, he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her...  I'm a great guy. I'm gonna open her eyes. Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know? No, he's not gonna open her ears. Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course. He's gonna open her eyes. Was Nick going to...  Make her realize he was great. Yes, that's exactly what that means. He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes. I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  He's gonna open her eyes. Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes. Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl. He was only going to open...  Stephanie's eyes. He said, I'm gonna open her eyes. I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes. I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do? How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie and he told her, I love you!  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared. Then even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried. Finally, Nick broke into her apartment. He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him. She was surprised. She was scared. She said, enough!  This is where the police come in. Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. She decided...  This is where the police come in. This is where the police should begin. This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in. It means time to call the police. Time for the police to start doing their work.  She said, this is where the fire department comes in. I don't know. Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help? Well, she said, this is where the police come in. She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in and then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail. He's in prison. And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone? Yes, that's right. Stephanie is finally alone. She's finally separate from Nick.  She finally has some space. The Stephanie finally has space from Nick. Yes, that is correct. Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail. Nick is in prison.

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Oh, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  or an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  And Stephanie came home.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago, but in  the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no.  Of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet or a girl named Julia off her  feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Nope.  He didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no.  She wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully?  Was she telling the truth that she was really into her job?  We don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time independent time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  We don't know, but I think not.  Maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No.  Not his arms.  His arms weren't hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no.  His head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no.  He would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  I'm saying he would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm not, I'm not.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie and he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  And even worse, then Nick started to follow her every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  And she said, this is where the fire department comes in.  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Does Stephanie finally have space from Nick?  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, Stephanie, is Stephanie awesome space?  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story after key phrases,  after important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.

Reason number one, I have been working, working, working.  All morning, all day, all night.  On Power English, my new Power English lessons.  And there's a lot to do.  Almost finished.  They will be ready very soon.  We will have a one day only sale.  Power English.  Anyway, you get my emails you already know about this.  You want more information, sign up for my email course.  The other reason that I have not done a podcast is that I have been doing audio tweets.  Talk about this in my previous podcast.

    "transcript_full": "The story of Arthur the Rat, once upon a time, there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in the horse voice.  I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside?  I would say yes.  Or no, neither.  He always should make a new choice.  One fine day is Arthur should be sent in.  I will care.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you are all in a piece you will live your past.  The young rat caught him of quiet as usual but said nothing.  Not true.  That's old.  It was not stepping her foot.  But she couldn't be able to see the young rat so cold.  I don't know.  It was all the ever answered.  And then he walked off to think.  And now all right, whether he would stay in his home and run him out into the rough.  One night the riffs really loud, lost and lost.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring from down, from Washington.  The riffs and the raps set all run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last one of it jostled away.  The beans fell with one inch on the third one.  But the riffs shook.  They typically fell off.  And all the rest pears.  The riffs on here were fewer and harder.  This won't be the finishery.  We can't stay, put the fear in and off.  So that's good for throwing it off.  A little later on that evening he said to come back and say they found an old fashion compound.  Or that would be...  He wouldn't go for all of it.  He could be all of it.  It's coming from it.  And that's all I know, right where he stood on the floor and all night.  Just named the old red house side of your mama.  That was the name of the shriek.  He wasn't in the line.  And he wasn't exactly outside you.  He stood just back here.  Come on.  Get in line.  Well, the old red Christmas.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know.  Said I'll come.  But the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here anymore.  Do you?  Yes.  And that's it.  That has been done.  You do.  May not fall in here.  Well, the old red Christmas.  Where you join us.  When you turn to the old shriek.  Right about the face.  Hearts.  And you don't want a heart back.  You used to burn body on that western.  I think I'll go tomorrow.  He said to himself.  But then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I guess I'll go back to my old under the ground.  Just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Someone came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard.  And he cut side of the young rat.  Hooked it.  Half in and half out.  Thus the shriek got his due and there was no warning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job.  I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't gonna take no or an answer.  I'm gonna show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie.  Finally, has some space.  Alright, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago.  But in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named...  Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  No, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend?  Girl, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  I don't know. She didn't want to.  She laughed in her to say,  and she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into...  her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise,  really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise?  No, no, not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully,  was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  No, we don't know.  Maybe not. Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said,  I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick  that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said,  I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  No, we don't know, but I think not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick,  I just need some space.  I just want to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt by Stephanie?  Yeah, same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  By Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself,  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Was he...  He was not going to take no for an answer.  No, no, no.  He was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, right?  I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't done enough.  I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't going to take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't going to take no for an answer.  He said, I'm going to show her I am a great man.  I am going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know?  No, he's not going to open her ears.  Is he going to open her eyes?  Yes, of course.  He's going to open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her...  Realize he was great.  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to make her understand how great I am.  I'm going to open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm going to open her eyes.  I'm going to open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm going to make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie,  and he told her, I love you!  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her every night.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  And Stephanie came home.  She saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough!  This is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow, it's time to call the police?  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  She decided this is where the police...  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police,  or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  It means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Did she say this is where the fire department comes in?  I don't know.  Didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in.  And then, she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail.  He's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does...  Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick.  Because Nick is in jail.  Nick is in prison.  So, finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time, I will tell the story.  After key phrase...  After important phrases with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause.  Please repeat.  Repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words.  Copy my pronunciation.  Here we go.  Let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved the beautiful girl.  Name Stephanie.  He wanted to...  Sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  He wanted to sweet Stephanie off her feet.  Good.  But he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said,  You want to go to dinner with me?  Good.  You want to go to dinner with me?  Okay?  He asked me nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Good.  I'm really into my job right now.  Very good.  Then she said,  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Good.

Then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail.  And...  Stephanie finally has some space.  Good.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Alright.  That's all.  Very good.

    "transcript_full": "The story of off of the rat, once upon a time, there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mom.  Whenever the other rat says to him, if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in the horse voice.  I don't know.  And when they said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes, or no, neither.  He'd always shake, making your choice.  One fine day, his aunt Josephine sent in, I'm here.  No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this.  You are no more mine if you're wrong, and if we see a little grass.  The young rat coughed quite as usual, but says nothing.  No, true.  That's so, said, was not stepping her foot, but she couldn't be able to see the young rat, so cold brother.  I don't know.  It was all the answer.  And then he walked off to think, or an owl, or a rat, whether he would stay in his home and run him out into the rat.  One night, the rats really loud, almost in the loft.  There's a very critical place, the roof, set the ring from down, from Washington.  The beams and the rats, as it all run at you.  So the whole thing was quite unsafe.  At last, one of the joists, really great.  The beams fell with one inch on the ceiling.  The rolls shook, and people really fell off.  And all of the rats' hairs stood from hand, with fear and horror.  This won't be necessary.  We can't stay, put the fear in the loft.  So, it's a nice catch for throwing it off.  A little later, on that evening, the cats come back, and they find an old-fashioned compound.  But I would be really good for all of them.  They could give you all the weapons, coming from it.  And that's from under all of my way, and still I'm sure I'm all not.  Just then, the old rat coughs out of your mouth.  That was the thing with the shriek.  He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside here.  He stood just back here.  Come on, get in line.  Well, the old rat coughs there.  Of course you're coming too.  I don't know, set off to come.  But the idea of it.  You don't think it's safe here anymore, do you?  And I'm certain that, as I'm done, you do not fall in here.  Well, so the old rat can't look for us.  But you join us, when you turn to the old shriek.  Right about for his heart.  And you don't want to hurt that.  You should use the barn volume that was in there.  I think I'll go tomorrow.  He said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.  It's so nice and snug here.  I go back to my old house.  Just to make up my mind.  But during the night, there was a big crash.  Downking means rat to enjoy the whole bit.  Next morning, it was a foggy day.  Some men came to look over the damage.  It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.  But at last one of them happened to move aboard.  And he got set of young rats, hooked dead,  half in and half out of his hole.  Thus the shriek got his due, and there was no mourning for him."

    "transcript_full": "Okay, let's get started with the mini story lesson for the hitch introduction.  Here we go.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick, he loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a date.  He said, uh, uh, uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  She laughed nervously and said, I'm really into my job right now, uh, I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Ah, Nick's feelings were hurt.  He knew Stephanie didn't like him, but he said to himself, I ain't going to take no  for an answer.  I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm going to open her eyes.  So Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Then he called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, let's go back to the beginning.  Once, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, maybe five years ago, three years ago,  in the past, once there was a shy guy named Nick.  He loved a beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet, but he was too shy.  Did he want Stephanie to fall in love with him?  Yes, that's right.  He wanted Stephanie to fall in love with him.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Did he want to be very, very romantic and surprise her and impress her?  Yes, that's exactly right.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  He wanted to impress her and surprise her with romance, with love.  He wanted to sweep her off her feet.  Did he want to sweep his sister off her feet?  Well, no, no, of course not.  That's a romantic meaning.  Sweep off your feet is romantic.  He did not want to sweep his sister off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet?  No, he did not want to sweep a girl named Angelina off her feet.  Did he want to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet?  Or a girl named Julia off her feet?  Well, he wanted to sweep a girl named Stephanie off her feet.  Was he able to sweep Stephanie off her feet?  Could he do it?  Well, no, he could not.  Unfortunately, he was too shy.  So he could not sweep Stephanie off her feet.  She didn't fall in love with him.  But one day, he did ask her for a date.  He said, uh-uh, you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask her if she wanted to go to dinner?  Hmm, yes, he did.  That's exactly what he said.  He said, do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask Julia?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Nope, he didn't ask Julia.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask his best friend?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Oh, he did not ask his best friend.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did he ask a friend or a girl?  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Well, of course, he asked a girl.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Which girl did he ask?  Well, he asked Stephanie.  Do you want to go to dinner with me?  Did Stephanie want to go to dinner with him?  Well, no, she didn't want to.  She laughed and heard me say, huh, huh?  And she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Was Stephanie really into her school right now?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She wasn't really into her school.  Was she really into her family?  No, no, she wasn't really into her family.  Was she really into exercise?  Really loved exercise, really focused on exercise,  really concentrating on exercise.  No, no, I'm not on exercise.  What was she really into?  Well, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  Is she really focused on her career?  Was she really focused on her career?  Yeah, that's right.  She was really focused on her career.  Was she truthfully, was she telling the truth  that she was really into her job?  We don't know, maybe not.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she was lying.  Maybe she's not really into her job.  Maybe she wasn't really into her job.  But anyway, she said, I'm really into my job right now.  I'm sorry.  I just need some space.  Did she tell Nick that she needed time alone?  Yeah, that's right.  She wants some time, independent time, time alone.  She said, I just need some space.  Did she just need some space from her friends?  We don't know, but I think not, maybe not.  Did she just need some space from her parents?  Well, again, probably not.  Who did she need space from?  Well, she needs space from Nick.  She told Nick, I just need some space.  She just wants to be away from Nick.  I can need space from Nick.  How did Nick feel about this?  Well, Nick's feelings were hurt.  Were Nick's arms hurt?  No, not his arms.  His arms were hurt.  Was his head hurt?  Oh, no, his head was not hurt.  Was he very sad?  Yes, that's correct.  Nick was very sad.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Was Nick upset?  I'm very upset.  Yeah, that's right.  Nick was very upset.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Who hurt Nick's feelings?  Well, Stephanie hurt Nick's feelings.  Were Nick's feelings hurt?  By Stephanie.  Same question, right?  Just a little different.  Yes, that's right.  Nick's feelings were hurt by Stephanie.  Why were Nick's feelings hurt?  Well, because he knew Stephanie didn't like him.  But he didn't give up.  He said to himself, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Was he going to take no for an answer?  No, no, no, he was not going to take no for an answer.  He said, I ain't, I am not going to take no for an answer.  I ain't gonna, I am not going to take no for an answer.  Would Nick accept this answer from Stephanie?  No, no, he would not accept no.  He would not accept this answer.  He refused.  He said, no, I will not accept this.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Would he take yes for an answer?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  He certainly would take yes.  He would love for her to say yes.  He just said, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Not, not.  He said, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to open her ears?  To know.  No, he's not gonna open her ears.  Is he gonna open her eyes?  Yeah, of course, he's gonna open her eyes.  Was Nick going to make her realize he was great?  Yes, that's exactly what that means.  He was going to make her realize, make her understand  that he is a great guy.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna make her understand how great I am.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Whose eyes was he going to open?  Well, he was going to open Stephanie's eyes.  Was he going to open every girl's eyes?  No, not every girl.  He was only going to open Stephanie's eyes.  He said, I'm gonna open her eyes.  I'm gonna open Stephanie's eyes.  I'm gonna make Stephanie realize I'm great.  What did he do?  How did he try to open her eyes?  Well, he bought 500 roses for Stephanie  and he told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then, even worse, then Nick started to follow her  every morning.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  He came into her apartment secretly.  When Stephanie came home, she saw him.  She was surprised.  She was scared.  She said, enough, this is where the police come in.  Did she decide, wow,  it's time to call the police.  Yes, that's right, that's exactly right.  She decided, this is where the police come in.  This is where the police should begin.  This is where I should call the police  or when I should call the police.  This is where the police come in.  Means time to call the police.  Time for the police to start doing their work.  Could she say, this is where the fire department comes in?  Oh no, didn't want the fire department to help.  Who did she want to help?  Well, she said, this is where the police come in.  She wanted the police to help.  She said, this is where the police come in  and then she called the police.  Now, Nick is in jail, he's in prison.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  Is Stephanie finally alone?  Yes, that's right.  Stephanie is finally alone.  She's finally separate from Nick, alone from Nick.  She finally has some space.  The Stephanie finally has space from Nick.  Yes, that is correct.  Why does Stephanie have some space from Nick?  Well, she has space from Nick  because Nick is in jail, Nick is in prison.  So finally, Stephanie has some space.  Righty, back to the beginning.  This time I will tell the story.  After key phrases, after important phrases  with new vocabulary, new idioms.  I will pause, please repeat, repeat my pronunciation.  Not just the words, copy my pronunciation.  Here we go, let's start.  Once there was a shy guy named Nick,  he loved the beautiful girl named Stephanie.  He wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, he wanted to sweep Stephanie off her feet.  Good, but he was too shy.  One day, he finally asked her for a day.  He said, you want to go to dinner with me?  Good, you want to go to dinner with me?  Okay, she laughed nervously and said,  I'm really into my job right now.  Good, I'm really into my job right now.  Very good.  Then she said, I'm sorry, I just need some space.  Good, I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  Okay, he knew Stephanie didn't like him,  but he said to himself,  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Good, I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  Good, I'm going to show her I'm a great guy.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  Very good, I'm gonna open her eyes.  Okay, so Nick bought 500 roses for Stephanie  and told her, I love you.  Stephanie was shocked and a little scared.  Then Nick started to follow her everywhere.  Stephanie became more worried.  Finally, Nick broke into her apartment.  When Stephanie came home, she said, enough.  This is where the police come in.  Very good, this is where the police come in.  Good, then she called the police.  Now Nick is in jail and Stephanie finally has some space.  And Stephanie finally has some space.  All right, that's all, very good.  Now please pause your iPod, pause your computer  and try to tell all of the story, everything yourself.  Just use the key phrases, right?  Sweet Stephanie off her feet, really into my job right now.  I just need some space.  Nick's feelings were hurt.  I ain't gonna take no for an answer.  I'm gonna open her eyes.  This is where the police come in.  Stephanie finally has some space.  Use those key phrases in your story.  You don't need to memorize every word.  Just try to use the new phrases correctly.  I remember this story is about the past.  Alrighty, good.  After you finish this, after you can remember  and tell the story, go to the next lesson,  the mini story, point of view list.  See you next time, bye bye."
