Reason number one, I have been working, working, working, working all morning, all day, all night on Power English, my new Power English lessons. And there's a lot to do. Almost finished. They will be ready very soon. We will have a one-day only sale for Power English. But anyway, you'll get, if you get my emails, you already know about this, so I don't need to talk about it more. If you want more information, sign up for my email course. The other reason that I have not done a podcast recently is that I have been doing audio tweets. I talked about this. I talked about this in my previous podcast. And I love these audio tweets because I can do them every day. They're so convenient.",

    "transcript": "The story of Arthur the Rat. Once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't make up his mind. Whenever the other rats asked him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in a hoarse voice, \"I don't know.\" And when they said, \"Would you rather stay inside?\" he would say yes or no either. He'd always shake making a choice. One fine day his Aunt Josephine said to him, \"Now look here. No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind of your own than a greasy old blade of grass.\" The young rat coughed and looked quiet as usual but said nothing. \"Don't you think so?\" said his Aunt, stamping her foot, for she couldn't bear to see the young rat so cold-blooded. \"I don't know what to do.\" \"I don't know,\" was all he ever answered. And then he walked off to think for an hour or more. Rather he would stay in his hole in the ground or go out into the loft. One night the rats heard a loud noise in the loft. It was a very dreary old place. The roof let the rain come down, come washing in. The beams and the rafters had all rotted through. So the whole thing was quite a mess. At last one of the joists gave way and the beams fell with one edge on the floor. The walls shook. The cupola fell off and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. \"This won't do,\" said the leader. \"We can't stay cooped up here any longer. So let's go.\" A little later on that evening the scouts come back and said they had found an old-fashioned horse barn where there would be room and board for all of them. The leader gave the order at once, company falling in. And the rats crawled out of the hole right away and stood on the floor in a long line. Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. That was the name of the shaker. He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside it. He stood just by it. \"Come on, get in line,\" growled the old rat coarsely. \"Of course you're coming, too.\" \"I don't know,\" said Arthur calmly. \"Why, the idea of it. You don't think it's safe here any more, do you?\" \"I'm not certain,\" said Arthur undaunted. \"The roof may not fall down yet.\" \"Well,\" said the old rat, \"you can't wait for us to--for you to join us.\" Then he turned his head and looked at the old rat. \"I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\" \"Well, I'm not certain.\"",

I don't know. I bet those men are going to get quite a reception when they get back here. Oh, yes. I'll be so glad when they land back now. I think that's pretty well fact because they've landed so many safely now that I feel relieved. Just getting off of the moon was the thing that was... Have they met with the one that was circling? Yes, they've rendezvoused. So I understand. That wasn't shown either, but they say they have rendezvoused. So that's a matter of making the circles. And then... Coming down. What do you sort of imagine for the future? Do you imagine them sending up ships? I think they will. I think they will do some more exploring up there. Very positive. Because that was such a very small area when you think of it, that they just gathered rocks and samples of soil and all. And they did probe for some samples. and just what was going to come of that.

    "transcript": "I have always felt a little knowledge and with time it has increased. And now that I am a big farmer, death is near, I don't know when my breath will stop. This feeling has changed in this age. I have changed that I was ignorant and I am ignorant. I don't talk to any religious person because he doesn't share. He keeps a fatwa of disbelief in his face. I am not a fool that people call me a disbeliever and I keep saying I am. There were big people. I am nothing. Nothing. This question used to come to my mind and heart that Mr. Hussain Ibn Ali and Kumba, who were martyred in Karbala, Nanna Ali Asghar, who were martyred, no one felt mercy, no one felt pity. And I used to think that Allah has seen all this. He has seen all this. How will he tolerate those atrocities that were broken. So, the story of the kings is still there. Even then, if we search for it, we will not find such an example. Now see, the wives were related to the Holy Prophet . They were related to the Holy Prophet . And the husband was related to the Holy Prophet . And the husband is related to Allah. And to raise this question is not even strange that how Allah saw all this. How did He tolerate all this? I was disappointed. How did Allah see all this? I used to fight with myself. I used to fight with myself. I used to talk to myself. I used to say, \"This has happened.\" And Allah saw this. They were not ordinary people. They were very big people. They were so big that the thoughts of the mind go out of control. The heartbeats stop. They go there and close all the doors of the whole universe. They were so big. They were so big. Yes, this has happened. Now, the big one has come. It has come. The death is near. I see. I am not afraid of death. I say that the big people have gone. But this question was the one, I did not want to go to the grave. I wanted an answer to this question. And I do not want to die without this answer. Yesterday I was sitting and I was thinking that all this has happened. So this should not have happened. I was thinking that I should have put these people in a grave. And then suddenly, my patience got smaller. Suddenly. Suddenly. I got an answer to this. I got an answer. Now first of all, you note that I am ignorant and thinking like this. I am sitting with an ignorant man. He can think like this. Outside. Outside. Outside. Outside. Sabar ka jab daman chota pada, tomat par ye khula, ke log Allah ki rah mein mal malal ye sab kuch dete aaye hai, badas karte aaye hai.
